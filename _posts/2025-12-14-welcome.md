# Hi
Hi  
This is my first official post (previous ones for testing don't count)  
I made this blog because I thought it was cool to have one. Also I wanted somewhere where I could document some stuff such as writeups/techniques.    

# Me
A little bit about myself,  
I'm a student.  
I enjoy playing CTFs, I started with Web exploitation but now im more interested in Pwn :)      
I usually play with my school friends or [Singapore Students Merger](https://ssmct.org/).

# Disclaimer
Perhaps the things that I post may seem trivial to some, but to other they may be the most bizzare thing. Regardless, I'll be posting whatever I want anyways lol 😛😝  
If you want anything removed/you realised that I posted something with wrong info/you just want to, feel free to reach me on [Discord](https://discord.com/users/896565983056117830).
