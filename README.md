This is just a simple website that I made  
I decided to make it about CTF because I like CTF  
note that the writeup for multiplier was written on the same day that the website was made (so its within a valid time frame you can view it on my github).  
I used pandoc to convert a md file to html.

Features that I have:
- footer
- 404 page
- link to another website (github)
- html list (ul tag)
- 3 paragraphs with different css
- special link (email)
- projects.html has audio
- special text formatting (strong tag, italic tag, underline tag)
- Custom imported Font from Google Fonts (Comic Relief)
- html Button
- CSS: hover
- html iframe 
- gifs
